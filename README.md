The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed an unprecedented disruption in
almost every part of the world, resulting in over 647 million cases of infection and 6.6 million deaths
worldwide by the end of November 2022. Not only it represents a scientific crisis, instead, it can
also be viewed as a social crisis, which eventually imposes an economic crisis. One of the most
significant unmet needs for the virus is its unpredictable clinical course, as the infection rate can be
caused by a multifarious range of unascertainable factors. Machine learning models and data science
methods undeniably perform quintessential purposes in scrutinizing significant and symbolic
infection factors as well as generating precise predictions on future circumstances by diagnosing
COVID-19 cases.
The purpose of our project is to investigate and explore COVID-19 infection from three distinct
perspectives: (1) To investigate different sources and causes of infection. (2) To analyse the relationship
between the number of daily new COVID-19 cases with seasons and further make predictions
on the number of daily new cases. (3) To figure out effective solutions to mitigate the spread of
COVID-19. In this study, we implemented classification models such as Logistic Regression models,
time series models like ARIMA and SARIMAX models, regression models like Ordinary Least
Squares regression (OLS), compartmental models such as the SIR model, and data analysis methods
such as graph plotting and correlation analysis.
Our study adds some novelty about the identification of unusual causes of infection, and effective
health policies that limit virus spread, which can be further premeditated by policy makers for
case diagnosis, formation of preventive policies, and infection trend estimation.
